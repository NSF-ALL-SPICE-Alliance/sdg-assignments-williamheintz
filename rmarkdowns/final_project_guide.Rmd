### Congrats!

You have made it to the end of the course, and now it is time for your final project :)

### General Guidelines

The final project will be a screen recorded video (use zoom) of you going through a *knitted Rmd* that **tells a story** with data visualizations 

- Requirements
  - A minimum of 4 Data Visualizations generated from *either* the SDR-2023-Data.csv or SIDS-SDR-2023-data.csv
  - Context 
    - Minimum of 8 sentences describing and interpreting each visualization
      - Questions to consider
        - What is the variable(s) shown? Why did you choose the variable(s)
          - **Be sure** to describe the variables 
            - For example:
              - Explain the variable normalized_score_sdg7_elecac is the percentage of the population with access to electricity
        - Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way? (map vs bar chart vs scatter plot etc)
        - What does the visualization show us?
  - A narrative
    - This *cannot* be a document of 4 visualizations that don't tie into each other / make sense together. 
    - Supplemented by your written sentences, the visualizations must tell a story
  - The code must be **reproducible**
    - You need to be able to Restart R, clear your environment (broom icon), and then hit the knit button to produce a knitted Rmd (similar to those on the course website). If there are any errors in your code, the knit button will prompt an error message instead of producing a document
    
- Project Suggestions
  - We want you to **be as creative as possible** but here are a few suggestions if you could use some guidance
    - *Focus on a country* and tell the story of that country within the SDG's
      - Give a brief textual description describing the country
        - Add some info that is not related to the SDG's to give the audience context
      - What is the countries overall SDG Score?
      - Make a plot of the 17 normalized sdg scores for that country
      - Highlight the SDG the country has the most success in and the SDG where the largest challenges remain
        - Explore the different indicators in each of these SDG's
      - Which cluster does the country fall into?
        - When you increase the number of clusters, which cluster does the country fall into?
      - For the scatter plots/linear regression in the statistics lesson:
        - Does the country follow the trend or is it an outlier?
          - Try a few combinations of SDG's on the x and y axis
        - How does the country compare to the other countries in it's region?
    - *Focus on an SDG* and tell the story of that SDG
      - What is the global distribution of that SDG's scores?
      - Visualize the SDG on a map
      - What are the indicators in that SDG?
        - What are they're normalized scores?
      - What does the global trend look like for that SDG?
        - ↑ ➚ →	↓
          - What do the trends look like for the indicators?
      - What are the strongest predictors of that SDG's normalized score? (random forest in machine learning)
        - How about the strongest predictors of one of the indicators?
    

### Coding Guidelines

Awesome! So let's think about the format of your R Markdown

First, you need to create a New R Markdown

- Name the R Mardown you project title
- Save your R Markdown file with the save icon (no_spaces_in_the_name)

Then you will want all the packages we use to be loaded in with `library()` in the very first code chunk 


Next, you'll want to read in the csv we're using (*either* the SDR-2023-Data.csv or SIDS-SDR-2023-data.csv)

  - To do this will assign the dataframe a name with `<-` and use the `read_csv()` and `here()` functions
  
Then we'll clean the names of the columns with `clean_names()`

From here, you're off to the races!

  - Make maps
  - Do some stats with scatter plots, linear regression, and correlation coefficients
    - Filter the data for a specific region and make a correlation matrix
  - Make bar plots and histograms
  - Ask questions about which countries cluster together
    - Increase the number of clusters
  - Predict an SDG score or indicator score and look at the most important features regarding the prediction
  
**Be creative, Ask questions, Don't be afraid to try, and Enjoy the process**
